# Multi-Objective Non-Intrusive Hearing Aid Speech Assessment Model

This repository contains the official implementation of our paper:  
**[Multi-Objective Non-Intrusive Hearing Aid Speech Assessment Model](https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jasa/article/156/5/3574/3322471)**.

## Data Preparation

Please prepare the input data in a CSV file following the format below:

### CSV File Format:
The CSV file should contain the following columns:
| ref            | data            | HASQI | HASPI | HL                   | HLType |
|---------------|---------------|-------|----------|----------------------|--------|
| clean.wav | noisy.wav | 0.913 | 0.968    | [65 65 40 25 5 0]    | rising |

### Notes:
- **`ref`**: Path to the clean reference audio.
- **`data`**: Path to the processed version of the reference audio.
- **`HASQI`**, **`HASPI`**: The corresponding speech quality and intelligibility assessment metrics.
- **`HL`**: Hearing loss profile.
- **`HLType`**: Type of hearing loss.

Ensure your dataset is structured correctly before running experiments.

## Usage

Run the following command to train and test the model:

```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main.py
```

### Notes:
Details of the hyperparameters are listed in config.yaml.

### Pre-Trained Model

The Pre-trained HASA-Net+ will be released soon.
